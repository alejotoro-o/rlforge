Installation
============

If you already have Python installed in your computer, you can install RLForge with:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install rlforge

This will download and install the latest stable release of ``rlforge`` available in the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`_.

RLForge works with Python 3.9 or later, and depends on `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_. Intalling with ``pip`` will automatically download it if it's not present in your workspace.
